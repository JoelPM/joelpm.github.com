<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Work History</span></h3>
<strong>OpenX</strong>
Senior Developer
<em>10/2008 - current</em>
Building tools to help publishers monetize their content.

<strong>Google</strong>
Software Engineer
<em>02/2007 - 10/2008</em>
As a member of the AdWords front-end team I focused on improving the Keyword Tool (http://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal) by adding features (search volume data, ability to select which columns are visible, scrollable results table), increasing discoverability of existing features (through a UI refresh), improving performance (by integrating with a new back-end, rewriting the javascript, and adding JS pre-processing), and increasing test coverage (by providing a simple framework that allows a single set of Selenium tests to run against all the places the Keyword Tool is exposed).

In addition to working on the Keyword Tool I served as a 'build cop' for the AdWords front-end continuous build, working to quickly identify changes that broke the continuous build and notify the responsible party.

Additionally I was involved in the design and development of the next version of the Opportunity Center.

<strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong>
Web Programmer
<em>07/2006 - 02/2007</em>
Worked on an externally facing web-site allowing attorneys and clients to collaborate and easily share documents, calendars, forums, and other pertinent information. Used C# and ASP.Net 2.0 with SQL Server 2005.

<strong>Xanga.com</strong>
Software Engineer
<em>05/2005 - 07/2006</em>
I worked extensively on the ‘Upgraded Profiles’ feature which brought social-networking to Xanga. This work was done using ASP.Net 2.0 and leveraged the Atlas framework to provide a responsive, rich-client-like interaction within the browser that allowed users to categorize, filter, sort, and manage their connections. This project was unique in the way it moved much of the application logic into the browser and used the MVC pattern to bring order to the large amount of Javascript that powered the pages.

Prior to this I implemented a URL rewriting solution (in ASP.Net 1.1) that provided cleaner URLs for user pages and made user content more easily indexed by search engines.

I also worked with the Amazon ECS web-service and AJAX to create an interface that allowed users to search for books/music/etc and post links and images to their sites.

<strong>IBM</strong>
Software Engineer, WebSphere Performance
<em>06/2002 - 05/2005</em>
I worked on the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Performance tools team. From 2003 to 2005 I was primarily responsible for the design and development of Tivoli Performance Viewer (TPV). In WAS version 6.0 TPV was migrated from a Java thick client to an integrated part of the (web based) admin console. This involved a complete redesign and rewrite of TPV. My responsibilities included the conceptual design document, the system design document, as well as a much of the implementation work. I also worked with internal testers and beta testers to find and address defects prior to release.

I also served as a first responder when the build broke. In this capacity I was responsible for isolating the problem and either providing a patch or calling out the developer responsible.

Before that I did development for the WebSphere Performance Advisors, and before that I did performance benchmarking on WebSphere version 5.

<strong>SAIC</strong>
Intern
<em>05/2001 - 05/2002</em>
While working at SAIC I did development in C++/OpenGL for a modeling application in which I was responsible for implementing terrain rendering algorithms. While there I first implemented the Real Time Optimally Adapting Meshes (ROAM) algorithm described by Mark Duchaineau et al and the algorithm described by Peter Lindstrom and Valerio Pascucci in their paper "Visualization of Large Terrains Made Easy".

<strong>NCSA</strong>
Intern
<em>12/2000 - 05/2001</em>
While working at the NCSA I wrote a small GUI Java program to control a camera for video conferencing.  The camera was controlled via the serial port and I used JNI on Linux to
interact with the serial port (Java didn't support serial communication at the time).

<strong>Tellabs</strong>
Intern
<em>06/2000 - 08/2000</em>
When I was a summer intern at Tellabs I wrote a Perl program that allowed the hardware engineers to search and analyze the log files produced by the equipment they were working
on.  The GUI was written using Perl/Tk.  Users could pick an event type and a color they wished to display it in, or they could enter a regular expression and highlight the
results.
<h4>Languages/Platforms:</h4>
<strong>Java/J2EE</strong> - I've used Java at OpenX, Google, and IBM. The code I write is performant as well as readable and well documented.  I'm also familiar with Java related technologies like Maven, Spring, Hibernate, JSPs/Servlets, Webwork, etc. I've used Eclipse extensively and I've also used various tools to look at heapdumps and analyze memory leaks.

<strong>C#/.Net</strong> - I've done a significant amount of ASP.Net development using C# on both the 1.1 and 2.0 .Net CLRs at Xanga.com and at Latham &amp; Watkins. I've also used the Microsoft ATLAS framework extensively. For development I use Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2003.

<strong>Python</strong> - While at Google I learned Python and like using it to prototype algorithms and data-structures, as well as for doing scripting. I've also played around with Google App Engine and the Django framework.

<strong>C++</strong> - I haven't used C++ since I worked at SAIC, but I was fairly proficient at the time. I also took several computer graphics courses in C++/OpenGL.

<strong>Perl</strong> - I've written thousands of lines of Perl but I haven't used it in the last couple years. And it wouldn't bother me if I never did again.

<strong>Ruby</strong> - I've spent some time learning Ruby, but I find myself using Python more frequently.

<strong>JavaScript/CSS/AJAX/XHTML</strong> - I've used these plenty, as well as many of the frameworks around them (Prototype, Scriptaculous, Dojo, GWT, etc).
