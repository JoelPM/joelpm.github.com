title: Compiling HAProxy on OS X

<p>If you want to use PCRE when building HAProxy on your mac (recommended by the docs) and you've installed PCRE using MacPorts (<i>sudo port install pcre</i>), you may need to tweak Makefile.osx to help it find the headers, otherwise you'll see a whole slew of errors starting with this:</p>

<pre>
In file included from include/types/proxy.h:34,
                 from include/common/cfgparse.h:29In file included from include/types/proxy.h:34,
                 from include/common/cfgparse.h:29,
                 from src/haproxy.c:63:
include/common/regex.h:28:18:,
                 from src/haproxy.c:63:
include/common/regex.h:28:18: error:  error: pcre.h: No such file or directory
include/common/regex.h:29:23: error: pcreposix.h: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p>To fix that, open up Makefile.osx and find the two lines that define PCREDIR:</p>
<pre>
PCREDIR!= pcre-config --prefix 2>/dev/null || :
#PCREDIR=/usr/local
</pre>

<p>I commented out the first line, uncommented the second line and modified it to point at /opt/local instead of /usr/local:</p>

<pre>
PCREDIR=/opt/local
</pre>

<p>After that the compile worked. While I was at it I also set ARCH=x86_64 and TARGET=darwin, though I'm not sure if it actually accomplished anything.</p>
