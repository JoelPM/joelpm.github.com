title: "Curl with Cookies and Headers"
categories: ['curl', 'tools']

<p>Every now and then I find myself needing to make an http request with specific cookies and headers to help debug an issue. And every time I resort to the curl manpage and try a few times until I get the right incantation. So, to save myself time in the future, here is an example:</p>

{% highlight sh %}
curl -v --cookie "cookieName=cookieValue" --header "Accept-Language: en" --header "X-Forwarded-For: 123.123.123.123" "http://localhost:8080/somepage"
{% endhighlight %}

<ul>
  <li><strong>-v</strong><br/>Tells curl to be verbose, useful for seeing if your headers are being sent.
  <li><strong>--cookie "cookieName=cookieValue"</strong><br/>Tells curl to send the cookie header with the given value. Multiple cookies can be sent using "cookieName1=cookieValue1;cookieName2=cookieValue2".
  <li><strong>--header "headerName: headerValue"</strong><br/>Tells curl to add the header line you specified. You can send multiple headers by giving multiple --header arguments (see above).
</ul>

<p>The ability to hand-craft HTTP requests is a great feature of curl and makes it a great debugging tool.</p>
